Learning points :
* Using UI framework - react-Bootstrap
* internal wiring of the react app with hooks like useContext,useEffect ,useRef,etc
* made custom hooks like useClickOutside ,etc
* gained more experience with react-routing
*learnt to ingrate maps with free OpenStreetMaps through leaflet package . 
All other map apis like google maps and mapbox requires you to setup a billing account (requires credit card details).
react-leaflet uses openstreetmaps which doesnot even require an api key .

Things to be implemented :
* storing data in localStorage and linking it to context so the page doesnot break on reload.
